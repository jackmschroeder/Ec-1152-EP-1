# Start by looking up the city where you grew up on the Opportunity Atlas. Zoom in to the

# Opportunity Atlas. Examples for Milwaukee, WI (where Professor Chetty grew up) and
# Los Angeles, CA (discussed in Lecture 1) are shown on the next page. The text of your
# narrative should describe what you see, and what data are being visualized.
# Examine the patterns for a number of different groups (e.g., lowest income children, high
# income children) and outcomes (e.g., earnings in adulthood, incarceration rates). Only
# choose one or two of these to include in your narrative.

There are many things here.  

That are worth considering.  
```{r question 8, echo=FALSE}
# Using the Census tracts in your home county, can you identify any covariates which help
# explain some of the patterns you have identified above? Some examples of covariates
# you might examine include housing prices, income inequality, fraction of children with
# single parents, job density, etc. For 2 or 3 of these, report estimated correlation
# coefficients along with their 95% confidence intervals.

```{r question 9, echo=FALSE}
# Open question: formulate a hypothesis for why you see the variation in upward mobility
# for children who grew up in the Census tracts near your home and provide correlational
# evidence testing that hypothesis.
# For this question, many covariates have been provided to you in the atlas.dta file, which
# are described under the “Characteristics of Census tracts” header in Table 1.
# You are welcome to use outside data that are not included in atlas.dta, but this is not
# required. Diane Sredl has created a research guide for our class that contains links to
# other data sources. You may wish to read this tutorial on how to add variables to a data
# set in Stata.
```

```{r question 10, echo=FALSE}
# Putting together all the analyses you did above, what have you learned about the
# determinants of economic opportunity where you grew up? Identify one or two key
# lessons or takeaways that you might discuss with a policymaker or journalist if asked
# about your hometown. Mention any important caveats to your conclusions; for example,
# can we conclude that the variable you identified as a key predictor in the question above
# has a causal effect (i.e., changing it would change upward mobility) based on that
# analysis? Why or why not?
